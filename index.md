# Welcome to the Quicksand Rehydrated Wiki!

**Quicksand Rehydrated** (**QSR**) is an upcoming Minecraft mod that adds quicksand and other hazards into the game. It is heavily inspired by the *More Fun Quicksand Mod* for Minecraft version 1.7.10. QSR is planned to come with a number of companion mods to make it more friendly for modpack use and to cater to a variety of playstyles.

The mod is still early in development, and in need of contributors. The developers host a Discord server for anyone who wants to contribute or keep track of the mod's progress.
