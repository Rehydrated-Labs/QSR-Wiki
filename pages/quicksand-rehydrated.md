# Quicksand Rehydrated

**Quicksand Rehydrated** (sometimes called **QSR**) is an upcoming Minecraft mod that adds quicksand and other hazards into the game. It is heavily inspired by the *More Fun Quicksand Mod* for Minecraft version 1.7.10. QSR is planned to come with a number of companion mods to make it more friendly for modpack use and to cater to a variety of playstyles.

## Companion mods

The mod currently has four planned companion mods beyond Quicksand Rehydrated:

- [Quicksand Core]({% link pages/quicksand-core.md %}) — A more modpack-friendly version of QSR with terrain-themed hazards & structrues and [Hunnibees]({% link pages/hunnibees.md %}).
- [Quicksand Glacéed]({% link pages/quicksand-glaceed.md %}) — An addon that includes a candy world dimension and expands QSR's optional content.
- Quicksand Laboratory — At the time of writing (January 22, 2026), I could not find info about this companion mod. It was found listed in this Google Sheet: [QSR Wiki and Mod Planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mXdd2MN0EUf2hOWrWy8Gl7ejlJaeW5cSGVZ67DlmD_k/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0)
- Quicksand Carnivores — At the time of writing (January 22, 2026), I could not find info about this companion mod. It was found listed in this Google Sheet: [QSR Wiki and Mod Planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mXdd2MN0EUf2hOWrWy8Gl7ejlJaeW5cSGVZ67DlmD_k/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0)
