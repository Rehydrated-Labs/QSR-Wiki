# Bog

A **Bog** (sometimes called a **Forest Bog**) is an isolated body of water, often found in forests, with accumulated plant matter, mainly leaves from surrounding trees. They tend to have a dark, black-ish color and a clumpy texture.

## Generation

Bogs can be found in oak forests, dark oak forests, taiga forests, large taiga forests, and swamps.

It can generate either as a standalone pit of varying sizes or as elongated river- or revein-shaped pits that are full of forest bog mud.

Fern bushes and tall/regular grass blades grow on the out edges of the pit's surface, then duckweed, lilypads, and exposed mud can be found towards the middle. Lots of tall oak or dark oak trees can be found growing around the solid ground surrounding the pit. Occasionally, horizontal oak logs and muddy branches can be found on the surface. The pit's solid edges are made out of podzol dirt.

## Sinking

Accumulated layers of decaying leaves produce a particularly airiated substance that's lighter than many other substances.
